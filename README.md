2. Open the YogaTables.xcworkspace file with XCode.
3. Install the Injection II app: http://johnholdsworth.com/injection.html
4. Fire up the app in a simulator.
5. Make some UI change (i.e., a layout change to the CustomCell or change some static text, etc...).
6. Save your changes, then select the simulator window again and then press the CTRL and = keys on your keyboard. Your UI changes should appear.
